**Welcome to Dungeon Escape (Educational) ðŸ‘‹**

After having used my CLI Adventure Game to teach many beginner  
students as a software educator and guest lecturer, I decided to open-source  
the material in the hopes that it benefits others.

Feel free to contribute to this code-base or use it as you wish!

You may notice that some code could be optimized, shortened or more structured.
Keep in mind that this is introductive (although more advanced) educational material.
Therefore the focus was readable and understandable code for beginners with a basic grasp
on programming concepts such as primitive data structures, functions, loops and variables.

As this might be of benefit to any starting developer, I have decided to open-source it.
Enjoy, and feel free to open an issue on my github (AjobK) or send an e-mail (ajobkustra.p@gmail.com)
