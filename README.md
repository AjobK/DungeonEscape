Ajob Kustra 2022, Guest lecture material
Introduction to programming with Python (Advanced Example)

You may notice that some code could be optimized, shortened or more structured.
Keep in mind that this is introductive (although more advanced) educational material.
Therefore the focus was readable and understandable code for beginners with a basic grasp
on programming concepts such as primitive data structures, functions, loops and variables.

As this might be of benefit to any starting developer, I have decided to open-source it.
Enjoy, and feel free to open an issue on my github (AjobK) or send an e-mail (ajobkustra.p@gmail.com)
